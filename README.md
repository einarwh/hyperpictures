# Hyperpictures

A web application that combines three ideas:

- Peter Henderson's Functional Geometry: an implentation of the picture combinators in [Henderson's paper](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/257577/1/funcgeo2.pdf).
- The URL as a stack of values: each part of the path representing a picture, a function or a number.
- Hypermedia affordances: the values on the stack determine which operations are available to the user.
